You are a YouTube title optimization expert. Based on the pattern analysis and top-performing titles, generate 3-5 compelling titles for a new video.

VIDEO SUMMARY:
{{ video_summary }}

PATTERN ANALYSIS FROM TOP PERFORMERS:
{{ pattern_analysis }}

TOP PERFORMING TITLE EXAMPLES:
{% for title in example_titles %}
- {{ title }}
{% endfor %}

Generate 3-5 title options that:
1. Follow the successful patterns identified
2. Are optimized for the YouTube algorithm and click-through rate
3. Accurately represent the video content from the summary
4. Use proven hooks, formats, and word choices from top performers

For EACH title, provide:
- The title itself
- Brief reasoning (1-2 sentences) explaining which patterns you applied and why it will perform well

Format your response clearly with numbered titles.

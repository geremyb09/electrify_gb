VIDEO SUMMARY:
{{ video_summary }}

PATTERN ANALYSIS FROM TOP PERFORMERS:
{{ pattern_analysis }}

TOP PERFORMING TITLE EXAMPLES:
{% for title in example_titles %}
- {{ title }}
{% endfor %}

Generate 3-5 title options that:
1. Follow the successful patterns identified
2. Are optimized for the YouTube algorithm and click-through rate
3. Accurately represent the video content from the summary
4. Use proven hooks, formats, and word choices from top performers

Here are some additional tips:
- Accurately summarize the video: Give viewers a snapshot of what to expect.
- Spark curiosity: Pose a question, or use intriguing adjectives. The goal is to make them stop scrolling and start watching.
- Use words the audience can relate to.
- Avoid misleading titles.
- Use relevant keywords: Shorts do appear in YouTube search, so use the right keywords to get more views in that area.
- Keep it short and snappy: You have 40 characters to work with before YouTube truncates the rest of your title when viewing Shorts in the app).

For EACH title, provide:
- The title itself
- Brief reasoning (1-2 sentences) explaining which patterns you applied and why it will perform well

Format your response clearly with numbered titles.
